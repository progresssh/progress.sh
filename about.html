                <h1>What is Progress?</h1>
                <p>Progress is my attempt at getting better at the things that are meaningful to me and to strive for
                    life.</p>
                <p>It takes the shape of a fictional system that tries to grow from the ground-up, knowing nothing and
                    having to learn everything it needs for the majority of subjects, some features are pre-programmed
                    like speech and basic videomaking skills (quite the plot!).</p>
                <p>I've been meaning to be a programmer, a mathematician, an artist, and many more! All these things
                    I've been letting get past me, convincing myself they're unattainable due to the fact I have no will
                    to do anything to get there. Spending my life imagining and daydreaming about lives where I led
                    myself to get there. </p>
                <p>A few months elapsed since I got away from my bedroom lethargy and started to work on this project. I
                    found myself in bad shape, unable to focus for a little more than 30 minutes, lacking in energy,
                    battling against the vicious chains wanting to get me back into the comfort of waiting for death.
                    I'm getting better and I wish to show mysel and the world the constant improvement of my system, my
                    life.</p>
                <p>In complement to blog posts and tweets about what I do (or other things!), videos are definitely
                    planned and will be on their way once I've made sufficient things with Blender to make them, I'm not
                    aiming to make a masterpiece, just something at least decent.</p>
                <p>This is a lot of work, probably much more than I can fathom right now, maybe I'll end up with 12 hour
                    days of fully focused study, that'd be one hell of a feat for me. In any case, it is a journey of
                    perpetual improvement, hopefully making beautiful things bloom as a result.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, I just want the system to keep running.</p>
