            <h1>September 3, 2021 - START OF THE JOURNEY</h1>
            <p>The following is a review of my month of August, where the Progress journey truly started.</p>
            <h2>Prelude</h2>
            <p>First let us peek at a bit of my past. There were many projects alike Progress, spur-of-the-moment resurrections where suddenly I'd be infused with intense energy, a will to live, to get out there and explore the world beyond the confines of my bed. I remember many starting from when I was 10 years old, each one would fail in the span of 1 to 4 weeks but pave the way for the future, storing knowledge to be used for the next attempts. Over time I would gradually build resistance to hope, knowing the fall would be harder if I made the effort to believe. I've gone long periods where I couldn't do anything anymore, I'd stay on my bed, daydreaming, sleeping for 18 - 20 hours a day. </p>
            <p>Something couldn't leave my side though and that was dreaming, circumstances led me to be broken but I never could give up on what's out there in the fabricated visions I have of the world. Today still, I have a hard time getting past the feeling-repelling armor I've burdened myself with except for the moments I remember those fantasies.</p>
            <h2>Intangible Chains</h2>
            <p>Every time the opportunity for a new try arose, I'd feel as if it would be the last time I'd ever get a shot at life. I would suddenly awake from a deep slumber where I was entrapped in a world with no will, love, or interest, I couldn't touch or interact with anything. I'd just be there. I can't answer to questions like "What advice would you give to your old self?" because I feel as if there was nothing that could have been done. What incentive did I have to do so? I knew full well what was happening, but there was nothing to grasp, I was only withering away towards my final deliverance.</p>
            <p>Even now, I believe I'm insanely lucky to have these moments of consciousness, how many are entrapped their whole lives? I don't know if it's true, if for some there are truly no ways out. I even miss that situation sometimes, something compelling about being in your own prison until you can't tell the passage of time anymore, I'll probably expand on that in another post.</p>
            <p>Although the chains still weight on me to go back and forget myself to bed, what I live now is a rare occurrence I never managed to provoke, this light just shines all of the sudden and I have to do my best never to let it go.</p>
            <h2>So, concretely what's been happening?</h2>
            <p>I am "self-learning" (plenty of unconventional teachers on the internet!) web development as of now, ultimately among other things I want to do math and computer science, study things from the ground up, I'm new at doing stuff so this is a good entry point.</p>
            <p>In June, I managed to study 30 to 15mn sessions per week, finally getting a foot on the ground, despite falling asleep in front of the computer after those focused sessions.</p>
            <p>In July, I started to work-out, go on walks and keep the weekly 30 to 15mn study up, slowly starting to be able to manage fatigue as I no longer fell asleep despite being tired.</p>
            <p>In August, my mind finally set-in and I could finally take decisions and get a feel for myself with the control I built up, in total I studied for 36 hours. I learned basics of HTML CSS, now going through the basics of JavaScript. I appreciate that my will is unfaltering, not at a single moment I thought the next thing would prove to be impossible or that my aspirations were vain, I was left to find out. It was hard to stay focused for three consecutive hours (with breaks in between) reading docs and making programs but I somehow pulled it off. The chains definitely intensified in strength but where those same ghosts would entrap me for months or years, this time it was only for a week before I'd comeback again. </p>
            <p>I've been cooking nice meals for myself and been going for walks (sadly I haven't gone working out, I'll see you soon gym of mine!). It's hard to stay conscious, to question myself and where I'm going as the effort of doing stuff is taking a toll on my clarity. I'm confident this will get better though. </p>
            <p>I'm looking forward to September, consolidating on the "short-comings" of August. I have plans for art and videos, I really, really want to get started with math now but I suppose workload and productivity are things that are earned through thoughtful effort, it's probably too early to pull-off long focused sessions of multi-subject studies but it's not too far either. </p>
            <p>I'm getting there! It's a fierce fight but it's one I'm lucky to have.</p>
