            <h1>October 21, 2021 - Crossroads of Fates</h1>
            <p>
                I've gained enough information to roughly see the direction where each path leads now. On an
                afterthought I had decided that I was going to go with The Odin Project, it is aimed at getting you
                ready for a web devlopement job very fast. I thought I could use it to <em>test</em> my discipline and patience
                since It's all very hands-on and does well to enable problem-solving skills and autonomy.
            </p>
            <p>
                It all sounds like an excuse to me, I envisionned learning math and computer science because the seems horizon
                boundless. The effort required to breakthrough the initial hurdles of navigating fierce
                uncharted lands is great, and I would at least need some kind of motive or purpose to go such lengths.. Well, the problem is I don't even know why I want
                to learn that I'm a bit at a loss of meaning there, however if you'd ask me if I want to learn it a hundred times, I'd say yes as many times. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice the <em>it</em> in <em> I want to learn it</em>, truth is I don't even know what I want to learn, people go on
                ambitious voyages for treasure or the promise of an eden. It seems the way I am going about it is like
                honoring someone's will, the ghosts of the past linger calling to your duty. They don't help you nor
                give you energy to act, but during this apathetic phase it's the only thing I see myself doing. Those
                are tough questions and each time I seek to answer them my mind goes blank. Sometimes I want to be
                somebody, do something, confirm my own existence somehow and the rest of the time it's pure nothingness,
                invalidating everything that came before. So I have decided.
            </p>
            <p>
                From now until the time where I'll be required to work (which should be starting 2023) I'm betting on
                computer science and math. Not for any other reason than to invite serendipity, the unplanned and
                unknown discoveries,
                so to hell with those questions.<br>Whatever may happen in the next 2 years, I'll have tried.
            </p>
            <p>In more practical terms, I'll be using academic courses anons managed to get alongside other ressources
                to acquire the pre-requisite I need as I go and try to explain what I learn as I go. I will also record
                myself a day a week to see where I'm losing time or doing the wrong things, long ago when I used to play
                games intensively having that data helped a lot. Keeping a flexible and open-mind is seriously important too,
                no matter what I think, if it doesn't help the journey I don't think it should stay.. but that part I
                haven't clearly figured out yet.<br>
                I'm going as far into the vast expanse as I can, beyond, everything to find.
